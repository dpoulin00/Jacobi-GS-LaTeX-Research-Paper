He is a well known mathematician, has won numerous prizes, and has served as President of SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) and been involved with many other organizations. ``Linear Algebra and its Applications" is a classic undergraduate textbook in linear algebra. Section 7.4 "Iterative Methods for $Ax=b$" introduces the  general concept of iterative methods as well as discussing Jacobi's method, the Gauss-Seidel method, and SOR. The text also briefly touches on requirements of iterative methods to ensure convergence. This source will serve as a good starting point for more careful understanding of the algorithms and iterative methods in general. This will provide a bridge between the more advanced sources and the more basic sources listed. (Annotation by Dan Ellison)},

	annotate = {Richard S. Varga is an Emeritus Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Kent State University in Ohio. Varga received his PhD from Harvard 1954 and is an editor of the Electronic Transactions on Numerical Analysis jounal. This book is published as part of the Springer Series in Computational Mathematics and is an advanced text geared towards graduate or advanced undergraduate students. Nevertheless portions of chapter 3, ``Basic Iterative Methods and Comparison Theorems", that we are interested in are early enough in the book to be accessible. Varga discusses the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR methods explicitly and discusses rates of convergence and includes proofs of convergence for digaonally dominant matrices. This text will provide good information to compare efficiency of the algorithms and really analyze the performance of the algorithms. The proofs will also be useful in discussing convergence. This is one of the more advanced sources which will provide a nice depth to the project and provide a formal view of the algorithms. (Annotation by Dan Ellison)},

	annotate = {David Strong is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Pepperdine University. This source consists of a series of short articles appearing in MAA's JOMA journal introducing iterative methods such as Jacobi's method, Gauss-Seidel Method, and SOR through worked out 2x2 matrix examples. The content, accessible to a Math 200 student, introduces the methods by looking at the methods first as a system of equations (without matrices) and then introducing the matrix content. We chose to include this source because we thought it introduced the basic ideas very nicely and we were planning on incorporating adaptations of some of the examples in the MATLAB live script and when we first introduce the algorithms in the paper. In contrast to our other sources, this one stands out because of its numerous worked examples which simply are not present in other sources.  (Annotation by Dan Ellison)},

	annotate = {William Layton is a math professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Most of his research is in the area of numerical analysis. This is his only undergraduate textbook, but he has published a graduate level textbook and over one hundred other, non-textbook publications. Myron Sussman is also a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. His research is primarily in applied mathematics, much of it specifically focusing on fluid modelling. This text is meant for senior undergraduate students in mathematics, engineering, and other sciences. This text goes into great detail about iterative methods in general, as well as the Jacobi Method specifically, which is relevant to our topic. It also discusses how iterative methods can be implemented in computing, which will be especially helpful when we make our MatLab live script. This source is one of the most easily readable sources we have so far found. Since it is our class textbook, its style is familiar, and we certainly have the needed background to understand it rather fully.(Annotation by DJ)},

	annotate = {At the time of this source's publication, William Ford was a professor of computer science at the University of the Pacific. He has co-authored many books in computer science. His past works have focused on introducing students to data structures and computing in general. The book is intended to introduce students, including those without any knowledge of linear algebra, to the topic of linear algebra. The chapter on ``Basic Iterative Methods" is relevant to our project, as it explains the Jacobi, GS, and SOR Methods in a simple yet thorough way. The ample number of examples are especially helpful. Since we have more prior knowledge than the intended audience, this source provides a more basic understanding of our method than most of our other sources. (Annotation by DJ Poulin)},

The intended audience of this textbook are students of machine learning as well as engineering. It assumes only a knowledge of calculus. This textbook's chapter on iterative solutions discusses the Jacobi and GS methods in great detail, and is as such extremely relevant to the project. Since the source only assumes a knowledge of calculus, it provides explanations of the Jacobi and GS methods that are understandable. However, the engineering focus means that it is slightly less relevant than most of our other sources. (Annotation by DJ Poulin)},
